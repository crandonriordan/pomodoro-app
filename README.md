# pomodoro-app

This app is meant for personal use. I've found for certain tasks the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a great way to 'swallow the frog'.

My personal opinion si that pomodoro should be used for the stuff that isn't testing the boundaries of your knowledge and focus, but something that you're putting off. For example, in your day-to-day activities you may skip on writing documenation, drawing a flowchart, or drafting up a testing document. I'd recommend using pomodoro for those activities
